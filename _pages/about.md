I am a back-end web developer with multiple years of experience building RESTful APIs and developing a web application's back-end. I write efficient End-to-End integration test suites for a web application and RESTful APIs. As a software developer, I am skilful in writing automated test suites using selenium, Appium and Cypress. Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery(CI/CD) is a way to reduce the time for delivering software. CI/CD pipelines automate the software build and deployment tasks. I can build CI/CD pipelines and integrate the test suites within an existing CI/CD pipeline.
